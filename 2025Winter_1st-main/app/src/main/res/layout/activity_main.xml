It looks like you're trying to create a new `ResultActivity` for your Android application. The provided Kotlin code is the logic for this new activity, and it requires its own corresponding layout file named `activity_result.xml`.









The original XML code you provided is for `MainActivity` (`activity_main.xml`), and it should remain as it is.


To correctly implement the suggested code, you need to create two new files:

1.  A new layout file: `activity_result.xml`
2.  A new Kotlin class file: `ResultActivity.kt`

Here is how you can set up both files.

### 1. New Layout File: `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_result.xml`

This XML layout will define the user interface for your `ResultActivity`. It should contain views like an `ImageView` for the winning food, a `TextView` for its name, and buttons for "Retry" and "My Page", as suggested by the comments in the Kotlin code.
